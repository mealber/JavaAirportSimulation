##My Initial Thoughts:

- The abstract factory design pattern would be a good design pattern to use to create different types of airports and airplanes. This is because I could have an abstract version that includes the necessary attributes such as capacity or fuel efficiency for airplanes, or gates and runways for airports. The concrete versions of these classes could then specify specific numbers for these attributes to create different airports and airplanes.

- The observer design pattern would be useful for running the simulation. This design pattern could be responsible for notifying passengers about their departure time and notifying airports about plane arrivals.
