# Airport Simulation

**Language & Tools:** Java, Gradle, GitHub Actions  
**Design Patterns:** Factory, Observer, State  

## Overview
This project is a **command-line airport simulation** designed to model the operations of a simple airport. It demonstrates object-oriented programming principles and design patterns to manage planes, passengers, and airport operations effectively.  

## Features
- Simulates airport operations including arrivals, departures, and passenger flow  
- Implements **object-oriented design patterns** (Factory, Observer, State) for modular and maintainable code  
- Automated testing and continuous integration with **GitHub Actions**  
- Build automation and project management using **Gradle**  

## Setup & Run
1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/mealber/JavaAirportSimulation.git
2. Build the project: gradle build
3. Run the simulation:gradle run

## Project Highlights
- Reinforces **software engineering best practices** including modular design and automated testing  
- Provides hands-on experience with **CI/CD workflows** via GitHub Actions  
- Demonstrates familiarity with **Java programming and design patterns**  

## Notes
- **Prerequisite:** Gradle must be installed to build and run the project
